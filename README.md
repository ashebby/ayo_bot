Inverted Pendulum (Self Balancing Robot/Segway) 
- Inverted Pendulum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum
- Segway https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Segway_PT

Components Used:
- Arduino UNO: An embedded system acting as the main controller of the entire system. 
Uitilized the Arduino IDE using C programming Language
- MPU6050: MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyro in a single chip to sense the angular velocity of the Robot.
- L298N Motor Controller: To control the Lego NXT motors via Pulse Width Modulation.
- LCD Screen & potentiometer (POT) controllers to control PID parameters
- Lego NXT Motors: As part of the LEGO BRICK Pack
- LIP0 Battery: Power Source

Thanks to this post I was able to build mine: http://www.instructables.com/id/Chappie-Self-Balancing-Robot/
